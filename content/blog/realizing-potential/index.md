So there is this anime called ‘My Hero Academia’ (hereby referred to as MHA), which is about a boy called Izuku Midoriya, in a world where 80% of the population has superpowers, that they call ‘quirks’. Izuku is part of the rest of the ‘quirkless’ 20% of the population but with a real strong wish to become a hero, irrespective of whether he has a quirk.

Through a turn of events, he receives a power called ‘One for all’ which gets passed down to him from his idol, All Might, the most powerful hero in the world. It’s like all of Izuku’s dreams suddenly come true and he is elated. But there is a catch, his quirk is a power that is passed down through generations of powerful superheroes, and he is the 9th holder of the power. This means that the power is nine times more powerful than when it started and too much to handle for a 13 year old Izuku.

He trains very hard just for his body to be able to accept the power, while All Might supervises his training. Every time he tries to throw a punch or a kick he ends up breaking his own limbs rendering him useless for the rest of the fight. He has to learn NOT to use 100% of it to avoid breaking himself.

And I think this is a great analogy about realizing potential. I truly believe that I have a lot of potential yet to be realized, but every time I try to utilize myself I either end up completely exhausted after one attempt or never use it fully at all. To put it into perspective, I have a recurring problem of starting multiple projects, getting carried away with one or two, working literally my ass off for days on end and then being so drained from working that I end up quitting. I have an unsightly grave of abandoned projects this way. But, just like our protagonist in MHA, I think I may have come across a solution to my problem.

Like some kind of self fulfilling prophecy, the solution is probably in the problem itself: multiple projects. What if, instead of focusing on one or two and unhealthily working my ass off on them till I drain myself, I could work on 5 at a time and work at 20% potential on each of them, with more or less equal importance. Perhaps my problem is different, and the solution may also be different entirely, but we won't know until we try.

So we’ll see how that works out for me.
