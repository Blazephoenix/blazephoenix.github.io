I’m pretty sure someone must have done something like this before, but I couldn’t find it. So after a little bit of struggling around with SCSS mixins and functions, I came up with this <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/Blazephoenix/aca2ab809fa44937f51452ce64b922c5#file-flexbox-mixins-scss\" title=\"Flexbox mixins for SASS\">gist</a>.</p>\n<p>More functions can be created and extended into the mixin such as flex-direction, flex-wrap, flex-grow, etc. with the @content directive in a similar way. It can also be used on properties that use the same values like justify-self or align-self. I will be updating this post with a github repo for all the functions and mixins soon.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Would love to know if anyone finds it useful.
